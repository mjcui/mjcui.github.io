<!--I am a first-year Masters student at the [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). My current research involves investigating entrainment in code-mixed dialogues, and I am being co-advised by [Alan Black](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/) and [Yulia Tsvetkov](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ytsvetko/). My work is mainly supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

Generally, I am interested in multilingual NLP and speech processing, low-resource language technology, non-native speech usage, code-mixing, and linguistics (specifically phonology and morphology).

Recently, I was at SRI International, working in their Speech Technology and Research Lab. Prior to that, I graduated from Wellesley College in 2016, where I studied Cognitive & Linguistic Sciences with a concentration in Computer Science. My [Honors Thesis](https://github.com/wellesleynlp/emilythesis) involved using machine learning to classify foreign accents of non-native English speech.

When I'm not working, I like to dance, take photos of handmade [felted animals](https://www.instagram.com/lintbuddies/), and read the latest novels by my talented friend, [Valentino Mori](https://valentinomori.weebly.com/). Once upon a time, I did taekwondo and rowing for sport. -->
